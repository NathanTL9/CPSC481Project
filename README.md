## About 

The information kiosk will aim to encompass many beneficial aspects of already in-place systems such as brochures/pamphlets, tourist websites, google maps, and more in order to try to replace the more traditional options and improve on modern options. The kiosk will satisfy the most basic functions of locating landmarks, establishments (stores, restaurants, recreational facilities, etc), events happening around the city, and providing general information about the city. The kiosk will also satisfy more advanced functionality such as giving directions to users, registration for events, and filtering to provide users with a simple, clean and clutter-free interface.
